#Introduction

Beginnings of a Boomi Atomsphere and partner API client written in C#.  This project is not finished.  
I need to work on something else for a while, I'm checking in this code so that it doesn't get lost.
Hopefully I'll get back to it someday soon. 

# Notes
This project can be built with Visual Studio 2013
